    "description": "Karl-Louis Kömmler, an ambitious chef who also happens to be self-taught, is at work in this small restaurant in Kreuzberg. He has the support of a professional and highly motivated young team, who clearly enjoy being part of the pared-back modern dining concept here. The food breaks with culinary conventions – based on the classics, it is strongly influenced by Japanese cuisine – and when it comes to the quality of the ingredients, no compromises are made. The menu comprises eight courses, in addition to specials that can be added on as an upgrade. In the veal sweetbread, they have a true signature dish: finely seasoned, crispy on the outside and creamy-tender on the inside, it is served with N25 Kaluga caviar and habanero sauce, which give the dish a pleasing kick with their brininess and wonderful heat – all in perfect harmony. It is powerful, pared down and original. The wine list may be on the short side, but it features a good selection. The front-of-house team is charming and highly knowledgeable, and the chefs themselves serve and explain the dishes. The minimalist interior is inviting. Seats are spread over two levels, with some at the counter, from which there is a view of the open kitchen. There is a small covered terrace in front of this corner building.",

An open kitchen, vinyl-covered walls, a beautiful mural designed by a Portuguese artist, and large windows are the backdrop for a pleasant, cosy atmosphere. The offering of talented Chef Pedro Almeida, here served up daily by the young resident chef Tiago Santo, reveals Portuguese cuisine with a Japanese soul, adopting the techniques of the Far East country and applying them to the best local produce. Across two tasting menus — Kiri and Yama, with 7 and 9 courses, respectively — the selection translates into bold dishes like the roasted tomato nigiri, the Kakuni-style beef tongue served with scorched aubergine and tomato, or the surprising dessert of Hachi (honey and oats).",

His different tasting menus The Story, Echoes of 100 (vegetarian) and Lunch Short Story (served exclusively for lunch on Fridays and Saturdays), are based around innovative cuisine with a constant nod (both physical and emotional) to his origins, although influences from his adopted homeland and further afield are also evident. His more traditional starters and desserts also have an interesting twist given that he used to make these with his mother!",

    "description": "A culinary enclave well worth considering in the historic Chiado district, which toys with Newton’s law of universal gravitation to create its own \"Gravitational Taste\" concept. Here, behind the robust façade of an old building, you’ll find an informal, more modern interior that includes an open-view kitchen and dining rooms lit in a contemporary, minimalist fashion. Enjoy superb views across the Tagus estuary to a backdrop of geometrically shaped ceilings and azulejo panels which are a silent testament to the past but which add appropriate character and personality. The creative cooking on display is highly visual yet at the same time elegant, pure and with a strong focus on vegetables. French chef Vincent Farges follows the thinking of Leonardo da Vinci in his defence of \"simplicity and maximum sophistication\", focusing on the essentials to elevate the dining experience via two tasting menus: Inspirações (8 courses) and Epurismo (10 courses).",

At the head of the kitchen is chef Fábio Alves, from Trás‑os‑Montes, who seeks to recall recipes from his native region through authentic flavours and aromas — as in the starters served in a glass box, with small snacks of Alheira (smoked bread‑and‑meat sausage), bacalhau (salt‑cod), tomato, broa (cornbread), folar (Easter loaf) and azeitona (olive). However, the menu does not forget dishes from the rest of the country, nor the magnificent fish from the Portuguese coast, such as the appealing course comprising Atlantic fish, millet and razor clam. The offering, presented with a modern touch, is composed of three tasting menus (Full Experience, 5 or 4 courses) and a reduced à la carte menu with vegetarian options. At the end, go up to the incredible panoramic terrace and enjoy 360º views over the beautiful city of Lisbon. But note if you wish to go as a family, as only children aged 12 and over are accepted!",

    "description": "This spot is somewhat hidden away in the Alcântara district, and its name bears a certain mysticism; not without reason, as it alludes to the four elements of nature (Earth, Water, Fire and Air). Brazilian chef Habner Gomes, well supported by José Balau as dining room director and sommelier, offers a Japanese-inspired proposal in the kaiseki style, presenting a single omakase tasting menu that reveals extensive expertise and extreme refinement, as the dishes are plated with the utmost attention to detail. It features a comfortable sushi counter for ten diners, and goes beyond the usual raw cuisine to introduce us to Japan’s hot dishes, with tasty broths and grilled preparations. Curious details? The dishes, which always celebrate fish from the Portuguese coast (seabream, Atlantic leerfish, eel, Azorean bonito, etc.), take their names from the techniques used (Sakizuke [appetiser], Otsukuri [sliced raw fish], Niguirizushi [hand-formed sushi], Agemono [deep-fried dish], etc.).",

Located in a quiet side street between the small Viktoria-Luise-Platz, laid out in 1899, and the department store KaDeWe, the restaurant delivers a five-course set menu, plus two dishes as an optional extra. Just a handful of components go into the fantastic, classically based dishes. Delicious examples include the flavoursome lobster soup with vanilla radish or the perfectly cooked saddle of venison with a robust venison jus and Brussels sprouts. The attractive interior is quite minimalist, with interesting photographs of Berlin and New York (taken by Oliver Körber's daughter) adding a decorative element. There are only a few spots up for grabs each evening, so be sure to book in good time! In summer, make a beeline for the gorgeous little terrace!",

They serve a six-course set menu made using seasonal ingredients, into which chef Daniel Horner (previously sous-chef at Japanese restaurant Mochi) and his team cleverly incorporates the odd subtle Asian flavour. Drawing on a selection of Austrian and international wines, sommelier Vanessa Schober recommends pairings for the set menu. Non-alcoholic tea accompaniments are also available. Diners can alternatively opt for a shortened tasting menu comprising just four courses. The cheerful, modern decor has an urban feel. You can also take in temporary art exhibitions here – the proprietor owns a gallery.",

But the team persevered and today are a standard-bearer of the MICHELIN Green Star. They grow about 300 varieties of vegetables, herbs and fruit both on site and in their larger field in the Beemster Polder. What is harvested in the morning from the imposing greenhouse will take pride of place on the plate a little later, in light, modern creations. Tip: make a beeline for the fabulous garden terrace. Wim de Beer and Jos Timmer are masters in the art of delicately balancing sweet and sour flavours. Subtle sauces highlight the creative vegetable dishes (sometimes with meat or fish). For example, a soft saffron cream elevates the smoky flavour of barbecued pointed cabbage, and the briny freshness of cockles is accentuated by a lime leaf emulsion. The wealth of natural produce that these chefs have at their disposal is a constant source of inspiration for their seemingly boundless creativity, and that is what foodies really revel in.",

For instance, he marries intense beetroot cooked in a salt crust and an emulsion of egg yolk with subtle acidity to create a remarkable flavour sensation. The select wines add to this unique sense of harmony.",

Chef Nicky Quarz cooks here with classic precision and a penchant for dishes that are too often forgotten. No frills and full of flavour. Think homemade wild boar pâté with lively garnishes that provide a nice counterbalance, or juicy guinea fowl stuffed with tartufata and served with soft pommes fondantes and a creamy mushroom sauce, among other things. This cuisine remains true to its roots. And more good news: the full menu is also available for lunch.",

    "description": "Dennis Huwaë is renowned for his work at MICHELIN-starred Daalder but also appreciates the simplicity of classic bistro cuisine. And this is abundantly clear at his elegantly furnished restaurant on a corner plot in the heart of the Jordaan neighbourhood. A relaxed atmosphere reigns in the warmly lit interior. Choose between a table or a spot at the marble counter, then kick things off with a freshly shaken cocktail as you peruse the frequently updated menu. Start with oysters or caviar on toast, then move on to chopped lobster tail and razor clams paired with creamy orzo and crisp vegetable accoutrements. Alluring bistro flavours and refreshing modern touches breathe life into every dish at this hip gastrobar!",
